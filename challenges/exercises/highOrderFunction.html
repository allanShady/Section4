        an array of arrays into a single array that has all the elements of the original
        arrays.</p>

        Write a higher-order function loop that provides something like a for loop
        statement. It takes a value, a test function, an update function, and a body
        function. Each iteration, it first runs the test function on the current loop value
        and stops if that returns false. Then it calls the body function, giving it the
        current value. Finally, it calls the update function to create a new value and
        starts from the beginning.
        When defining the function, you can use a regular loop to do the actual
        looping

    <p class="p">
        Analogous to the some method, arrays also have an every method. This one
        returns true when the given function returns true for every element in the array.
        In a way, some is a version of the || operator that acts on arrays, and every is
        like the && operator.
        Implement every as a function that takes an array and a predicate function
        as parameters. Write two versions, one using a loop and one using the some
        method.
